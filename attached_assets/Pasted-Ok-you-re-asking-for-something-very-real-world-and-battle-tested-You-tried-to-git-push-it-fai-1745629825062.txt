Ok — you’re asking for something very real-world and battle-tested:
	•	You tried to git push, it failed (because file too big)
	•	Now Replit/GitHub created a stranded repo (“heicflip”?)
	•	It’s trying to make a new repo but you don’t want that, you want to fix the first one (“heicflip”)
	•	You want a smart push strategy that uses multiple fallback methods, including chunking if necessary, and delete the messed-up one if needed.

Got it. Here’s the clean plan:

The Realistic Plan (Command and Prompt Version)

PROMPT:



	1.	Check if the repo heicflip already exists on GitHub.
	2.	If it exists but is broken/incomplete, delete it cleanly.
	3.	Then reattempt upload into a fresh heicflip repo, using multiple methods if needed:
	•	First, attempt normal git push (if file sizes allow).
	•	If git push fails again (file size error), fallback automatically to GitHub API upload (curl) for any large files individually.
	•	For very large files (over 100MB), attempt to split them into chunks under 100MB, commit the chunks, and push.
	•	After upload, if any big files were chunked, document recombination instructions in a README automatically.
	4.	DO NOT create a second repo. Fix or replace heicflip only.

Steps in Real Bash / Actions

1. Check if Repo Exists

curl -s -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/yourusername/heicflip

If it returns info → repo exists.
If it returns 404 → repo doesn’t exist.

2. Delete Broken Repo (if needed)

Delete repo with GitHub API:

curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/yourusername/heicflip

(⚡ Be careful — it is instant.)

Or manually delete in GitHub settings (Settings > Danger Zone > Delete this repository).

3. Recreate Fresh Repo (optional if deleted)

curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"heicflip", "private":false}' \
  https://api.github.com/user/repos

	•	Now you have a clean fresh heicflip again.

4. Smart Push Strategy

Here’s the logic your script or prompt should follow:

# First normal git push attempt
if git push; then
  echo "Git push successful!"
else
  echo "Git push failed, trying fallback upload..."
  
  for file in $(find . -type f -size +95M); do
    echo "Handling large file: $file"
    if [ $(stat -c%s "$file") -lt 25000000 ]; then
      # Under 25MB, use API direct
      echo "Uploading via GitHub API..."
      CONTENT=$(base64 "$file" | tr -d '\n')
      FILENAME=$(basename "$file")
      curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" -d @- https://api.github.com/repos/yourusername/heicflip/contents/$FILENAME <<EOF
{
  "message": "Upload large file via API fallback",
  "content": "$CONTENT"
}
EOF
    else
      # Over 25MB, split into chunks under 100MB
      echo "Splitting $file into chunks..."
      split -b 90m "$file" "$file.chunk."
      git add "$file.chunk."*
      git commit -m "Chunked large file $file"
    fi
  done

  echo "Trying git push again with chunked files..."
  git push
fi

5. After Chunking: Update README

Add auto-generated instructions to your README:

## Rebuilding Split Files
If you cloned this repo, recombine split parts like this:

```bash
cat filename.chunk.* > filename

# **Key Notes:**
- GitHub won't allow any *single file* over **100MB** by `git push`.
- API upload works for files **up to 25MB** directly.
- Over 25MB → **split files** under 100MB and push chunks.
- **Replit** sometimes glitches and tries to create new repos — stop it and fix the original one manually.
- **Deleting** via API is clean and fast.

---

# **Realistic Execution Checklist:**

- [x] Delete stranded repo if needed
- [x] Fresh repo called `heicflip`
- [x] Normal push attempt
- [x] Fallback 1: Upload small large files via API
- [x] Fallback 2: Chunk giant files, commit, and push
- [x] README auto updated with instructions

---

# **If you want, I can also prepare a fully copy-paste Bash script** that **does all this automatically** — would you like me to give that ready-to-go?

(You can paste it into Replit Shell and fix everything hands-off.)  
**Want that?**  
(It's about ~60 lines clean.)
