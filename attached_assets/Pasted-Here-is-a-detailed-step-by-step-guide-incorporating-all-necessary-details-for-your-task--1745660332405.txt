### **Step 1: Delete the `heicflip` Repository**
1. **Ensure You Have Administrative Permissions**:
   - Verify that you have the proper permissions to delete the repository. Only the repository owner or users with admin rights can delete it.

2. **Delete the Repository via GitHub**:
   - Navigate to the `brookcs3/heicflip` repository on GitHub:  
     [https://github.com/brookcs3/heicflip](https://github.com/brookcs3/heicflip).
   - Click on the **Settings** tab in the repository.
   - Scroll down to the **Danger Zone** section at the bottom of the settings page.
   - Click on the **Delete this repository** button.
   - You will be prompted to confirm the deletion by typing the repository name (`brookcs3/heicflip`) as a confirmation step.
   - Once confirmed, the repository will be permanently deleted.

   **Important Note**: Deleting a repository is irreversible. Make sure you have a backup of any critical data before proceeding.

   For additional details, refer to the [GitHub repository deletion guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository).

### **Step 2: View Build Logs of the `aviflip` Project**
1. **Access the Build Logs**:
   - Open the build log of the successful `aviflip` project by visiting the following link:  
     [Build Logs for AVIFlip](https://github.com/brookcs3/aviflip/actions/runs/14656346061/job/41132018317).

2. **Review the Logs**:
   - Pay close attention to the following sections in the logs:
     - **Cloning Stage**: Verify the branch and commit that were used during the build.
     - **Dependency Installation**: Review the `npm install` process and note any specific dependency versions.
     - **Build Command**: Review the `npm run build` or equivalent command and confirm that it completed without errors.
     - **Output Details**: Check where the build artifacts were generated.

   **Key Information to Note**:
   - The successful configuration of `aviflip` for reference.
   - Any specific warnings or optimizations that might improve the new `heicflip` project.

### **Step 3: Rebuild the `heicflip` Project for a New Repository**
1. **Clone the `aviflip` Repository**:
   - Run the following command to clone the `aviflip` repository as a template:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/brookcs3/aviflip
     ```
   - This will create a local copy of the `aviflip` project, which you can use as a base for the new `heicflip` project.

2. **Set Up the New Project**:
   - Rename the directory to `heicflip`:
     ```bash
     mv aviflip heicflip
     cd heicflip
     ```
   - Update project-specific files:
     - **`package.json`**:
       - Update the project name from `aviflip` to `heicflip`.
       - Modify any metadata like the description to reflect the new project purpose.
     - **Color Scheme**:
       - Update the UI components to use the `heicflip` amber/orange color theme:
         - Primary: `#DD7230`
         - Secondary: `#B85A25`
         - Accent: `#F39C6B`.
     - **Format Conversion Logic**:
       - Replace the AVIF-to-JPG conversion logic with HEIC-to-JPG logic.
       - For example, ensure the relevant modules or libraries for handling HEIC files are installed and configured.

   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Test the Project Locally**:
   - Build the project locally to ensure setup success:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - If any errors occur, compare with the `aviflip` build logs to identify discrepancies.

### **Step 4: Push the New `heicflip` Project to a GitHub Repository**
1. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository with the name `heicflip`:  
     [Create New Repository](https://github.com/new).

2. **Initialize Git in the Project Directory**:
   - In the `heicflip` project directory, run the following commands:
     ```bash
     git init
     git remote add origin https://github.com/brookcs3/heicflip
     ```

3. **Push the Code to GitHub**:
   - Add, commit, and push the project to the new repository:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit for HEICFlip project"
     git push -u origin main
     ```

### **Step 5: Align with the Successful Build of `aviflip`**
1. **Compare Configurations**:
   - Ensure that `heicflip` has a similar setup to `aviflip`:
     - **Build Tools**: Check `vite.config.ts` or similar configuration files.
     - **Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies are included in `package.json`.

2. **Deploy the New Project**:
   - Deploy the new `heicflip` project to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel).
   - Monitor the deployment logs to ensure success.

3. **Debug Any Issues**:
   - If the deployment fails, review the build logs from both `heicflip` and `aviflip` to identify and resolve any problems.
   - Common issues might include missing dependencies, incorrect paths, or configuration mismatches.

### **Key Differences Between AVIFlip and HEICFlip**
1. **Format Conversion**:
   - AVIFlip: Converts between AVIF and JPG formats.
   - HEICFlip: Converts between HEIC and JPG formats.

2. **Color Scheme**:
   - AVIFlip: Uses a blue color theme.
   - HEICFlip: Uses an amber/orange color scheme:
     - Primary: `#DD7230`
     - Secondary: `#B85A25`
     - Accent: `#F39C6B` (based on Pantone Amberglow).
