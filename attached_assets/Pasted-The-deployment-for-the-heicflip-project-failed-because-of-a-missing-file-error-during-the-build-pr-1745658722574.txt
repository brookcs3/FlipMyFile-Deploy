The deployment for the `heicflip` project failed because of a missing file error during the build process, specifically:

```
Could not load /vercel/path0/client/src/components/ui/tooltip (imported by client/src/App.tsx): ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/vercel/path0/client/src/components/ui/tooltip'
```

This error indicates that the file or module `client/src/components/ui/tooltip` is being imported in your code (`client/src/App.tsx`), but it does not exist in the specified path. On the other hand, the `aviflip` deployment succeeded because it likely did not encounter similar issues, such as missing files or modules.

### Why `heicflip` Build Failed
1. **Missing File or Module**:
   - The build process tried to import `client/src/components/ui/tooltip`, but the file does not exist in your repository or deployment environment.
   - This could happen if:
     - The file was accidentally deleted.
     - The file was not committed to GitHub.
     - The import path is incorrect (e.g., case sensitivity issues in file names).

2. **Different Project Setup**:
   - The `heicflip` project might have dependencies or code that differs from `aviflip`, which introduces this error.
   - For example, `aviflip` might not depend on the `tooltip` component, or its build process handles missing files differently.

### Steps to Fix the `heicflip` Build Issue
1. **Check the File Path**:
   - Verify that the file `client/src/components/ui/tooltip` exists in your local project.
   - Ensure it is committed to the `main` branch of the `heicflip` repository.

2. **Fix the Import Statement**:
   - Open `client/src/App.tsx` and check the import statement for the `tooltip` component.
   - Ensure the import path matches the actual file location, including case sensitivity:
     ```tsx
     import Tooltip from './components/ui/tooltip';
     ```

3. **Resolve Missing Dependencies**:
   - If `tooltip` is a third-party library or component, make sure it is properly installed via `npm` or `yarn`.
   - Run `npm install` locally and verify there are no missing dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Check Your Git Commit**:
   - Ensure all necessary files are committed and pushed to the `main` branch. Run the following command to check for untracked files:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
   - Add and commit any missing files:
     ```bash
     git add client/src/components/ui/tooltip
     git commit -m "Add missing tooltip component"
     git push
     ```

5. **Re-Deploy the Project**:
   - After fixing the missing file or path issue, trigger a new deployment on Vercel.

### Why `aviflip` Did Not Fail
- The `aviflip` project did not encounter the same issue because it either:
  1. Does not import the missing `tooltip` component.
  2. Has all necessary components and dependencies in place.
  3. Does not rely on paths or modules that are missing or incorrectly configured.

By addressing the missing file or dependency in the `heicflip` project, the deployment should succeed. Let me know if you need further assistance!
