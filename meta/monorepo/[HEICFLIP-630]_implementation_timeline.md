# Monorepo Implementation Timeline

This document outlines the planned sequence for implementing the monorepo structure, with each phase building upon the previous one.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup (Current)

- [x] Create directory structure
- [x] Set up package.json files with workspaces
- [x] Configure TypeScript
- [x] Implement core theme system
- [x] Create build scripts
- [x] Create variant generator script

## Phase 2: Core Package Population

- [ ] Extract common UI components to core
- [ ] Move conversion logic to core
- [ ] Implement shared utilities
- [ ] Set up proper TypeScript path aliases
- [ ] Add shared type definitions

## Phase 3: First Variant Creation

- [ ] Configure HEICFlip as the primary variant
- [ ] Move current app code to HEICFlip variant
- [ ] Update imports to use core package
- [ ] Configure Vite for proper bundling
- [ ] Test basic functionality

## Phase 4: Database Integration

- [ ] Configure shared schema definitions
- [ ] Implement proper database connections
- [ ] Set up environment variables for database access
- [ ] Test database persistence

## Phase 5: Ad Framework Implementation

- [ ] Create shared ad components
- [ ] Set up ad configuration system
- [ ] Add placeholder ads for testing
- [ ] Create ads.txt generation
- [ ] Implement cookie consent for GDPR compliance

## Phase 6: Second Variant Creation

- [ ] Create JPGFlip variant
- [ ] Configure theme with different colors
- [ ] Customize for JPG to HEIC conversion
- [ ] Set up variant-specific features
- [ ] Test conversion functionality

## Phase 7: Deployment Configuration

- [ ] Create Vercel configuration files
- [ ] Set up GitHub integration
- [ ] Configure custom domains
- [ ] Set up CloudFlare DNS
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Phase 8: Variant Creation Testing

- [ ] Test variant creation script
- [ ] Create a test variant (e.g., AVIFlip)
- [ ] Verify theme updates
- [ ] Confirm conversion functionality
- [ ] Test deployment process

## Phase 9: Documentation and Finalization

- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Create developer guides
- [ ] Document maintenance procedures
- [ ] Create backups
- [ ] Final testing across all variants

## Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Description | Estimated Time |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Core Infrastructure | 4-6 hours |
| 2 | Core Package Population | 6-8 hours |
| 3 | First Variant Creation | 4-6 hours |
| 4 | Database Integration | 2-3 hours |
| 5 | Ad Framework | 3-4 hours |
| 6 | Second Variant Creation | 2-3 hours |
| 7 | Deployment Configuration | 2-3 hours |
| 8 | Variant Creation Testing | 1-2 hours |
| 9 | Documentation and Finalization | 2-3 hours |

Total estimated time: 26-38 hours of development work

## Current Focus (Phase 2)

We're currently focusing on extracting common functionality to the core package while maintaining the ability to customize each variant. Once the core package is fully populated, we'll move on to creating the first variant (HEICFlip) using the extracted core functionality.

The variant creation script has been created early to establish the patterns and requirements for our variants, but testing it will be done in Phase 8 after all the core functionality is working properly.
