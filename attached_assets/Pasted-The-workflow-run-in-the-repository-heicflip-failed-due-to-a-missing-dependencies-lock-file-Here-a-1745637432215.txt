The workflow run in the repository `heicflip` failed due to a missing dependencies lock file. Here are the details:

- **Error**: 
  ```
  Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/heicflip/heicflip.
  Supported file patterns: package-lock.json, npm-shrinkwrap.json, yarn.lock
  ```
- **Workflow**: `Deploy to Vercel` (defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **Cause**: The workflow expected a lock file (`package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, or `yarn.lock`), but none was found in the repository.

### Solution:
1. Ensure that your project has a lock file generated by your package manager:
   - Run `npm install` to generate `package-lock.json` (if using npm).
   - Run `yarn install` to generate `yarn.lock` (if using Yarn).
2. Commit the lock file to your repository.
3. Re-run the GitHub Actions workflow.

Let me know if you need help updating or fixing the workflow!



Currently:
	•	The repo heicflip only has raw files (index.html, .ts, .tsx) and a .github/workflows/github-pages.yml
	•	The GitHub Action failed before (probably from a broken upload-artifact@v3 reference)
	•	Replit tried to create a new repo or push improperly
	•	It does not have correct folders like client/, server/, scripts/, or any vite.config.ts or package.json

Here’s what I need you to do:

⸻

1. Clean the repo and replace it with correct files
	•	Remove any leftover incorrect files from the previous Replit push (ex: DropConvert.tsx, heicflip-demo.html, config.ts)
	•	Copy in the complete working structure from my other repo (aviflip or equivalent):
	•	src/, public/, or client/
	•	package.json, vite.config.ts, vercel.json, .replit, etc.
	•	Ensure npm install and npm run build both work locally and on Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Actions

⸻

2. Fix GitHub Actions Workflow
	•	Replace .github/workflows/github-pages.yml with the following working version:

name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 20

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build

    - name: Upload Pages artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
      with:
        path: ./dist

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    steps:
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2



⸻

3. Push It Properly
	•	From Replit or local shell:

git add .
git commit -m "Replace broken files with deploy-ready structure"
git push origin main


	•	If Git fails due to large files, use GitHub API upload or split into chunks under 100MB (split -b 90m file.zip)

⸻

4. Final Check
	•	Confirm your heicflip repo:
	•	Has package.json, vite.config.ts, dist/ folder after build
	•	Works on GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify
	•	Looks just like aviflip — full project, not just loose files

⸻

DO NOT create a new repo.
Fix the existing heicflip repo completely.
Make it work like aviflip with a clean deploy flow.
