# Browser-based Processing Decision

## Decision

Process all image conversions directly in the browser using client-side JavaScript/WebAssembly without sending files to the server.

## Context

When designing HEICFlip, we needed to determine whether file processing should happen on the client or server.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Server-side Processing**:
   - Upload files to the server
   - Process with Node.js or native libraries
   - Send processed files back to the client

2. **Client-side Processing**:
   - Process files directly in the browser
   - Use Web Workers for performance
   - No file upload needed

## Rationale

We chose client-side processing for these reasons:

1. **Privacy**: Files never leave the user's device
2. **Performance**: No upload/download delays
3. **Scalability**: Server costs don't increase with usage
4. **Reliability**: Works even with unstable connections

## Consequences

- Limited to browser capabilities and Web APIs
- More complex client-side code
- Browser compatibility concerns
- File size limitations based on browser memory

## Implementation Notes

- Use Web Workers to prevent UI blocking
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers
- Use modern APIs like ArrayBuffer for efficient processing
- Balance compression level with processing speed
